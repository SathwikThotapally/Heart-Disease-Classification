# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification - Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning classification models** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health records.  
The goal is to evaluate multiple models and determine the best-performing algorithm using **hyperparameter tuning** techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the heart disease dataset  
- Train and compare different classification models  
- Use **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization  
- Evaluate models with accuracy and classification metrics  
- Select the most effective model for prediction  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Features include patient attributes such as:  
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina, etc.  
- Target variable: `0 = No Heart Disease`, `1 = Heart Disease`  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – ML models and hyperparameter tuning  

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest Classifier  

---

## ⚡ Model Optimization
- **GridSearchCV** → Exhaustive search over specified parameter values  
- **RandomizedSearchCV** → Random combinations of parameters for faster search  
- Compared results from both methods to select the best hyperparameters for each model  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Test additional models (XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks)  
- Deploy best model using **Streamlit/Flask** for interactive predictions  
- Integrate feature importance analysis for medical insights
